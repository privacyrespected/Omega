## Basic stock terms
1. Open: the opening stock price recorded everyday when the market opens
2. High: Highest point of a stock price
3. Low: Lowest point of a stock price
4. Close: The closing price of a stock price
5. Volume: the number of shares traded in a particular stock, index, or other investment over the day (according to the stock_data.csv case)
6. Dividends: a payment to shareholders that consists of additional shares rather than cash
For example, if a company issues a stock dividend of 5%, it will pay 0.05 shares for every share owned by a shareholder
Shareholders cut to of the company's profit
Traders thus buy the shares at least a month before the dividend is announced. The news of a dividend being announced increases the price of the stock. Once the dividend is distributed, the traders then sell the shares and earn good profits. This is just another way in which a dividend affects the prices of the shares.
